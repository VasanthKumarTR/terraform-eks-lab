# Terraform EKS Lab

This is a ground (or cloud) up deployment of an AWS EKS environment which can be used to build quick lab environments and easily tear them down for a true self-cleaning on-demand Kubernetes configuration.

## Requirements

You will need:
* AWS IAM credentials - currently using root credentials (which is not ideal)
* Terraform Cloud our Terraform Enterprise account


## About the Lab Code

Terraform configuration built for Terraform 0.13.4 or higher
